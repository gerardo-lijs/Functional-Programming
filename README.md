# Functional Programming in .NET
Curated resource links I've collected while doing functional programming in .NET. Some of them were very useful to me during my learning path and hopefully, they will help other software developers. Suggestions are welcome.

#### Books
* [Functional Programming in C# by Enrico Buonanno](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp)  
If you are a .NET developer and want to start with FP this is in my opinion the perfect book. It describes the concepts of FP with examples in C# code which enable you to quickly understand the benefits without the complexity/mathematics of other FP abstract books. It also includes many practical examples

* [Thinking in LINQ by Sudipta Mukherjee](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781430268451)  
This book will help you understand how LINQ works with hundred of Loop vs LINQ code snippets comparisons and also provides many refactoring samples using LINQ and FP in C# that will leave you amaze
